# Welcome to Exchange 

Exchange has been inspired by a personal struggle of mine when having my car being stolen and unable to find an vehicle that fit my criteria for nearly two months. This website provides a simple user-friend experience. The application is built using Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Flask and MySQL.
